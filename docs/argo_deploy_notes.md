# Argo Deploy Notes (Superseded)

This file previously captured ad-hoc Argo rollout notes from the app repo. It is intentionally kept minimal now. See the new structured docs instead:

- `docs/bootstrap.md` – cluster + Argo bring-up.
- `docs/release-workflow.md` – promotion, rollback, and hotfix process.
- `docs/argo-operations.md` – AppProject guardrails, sync policies, and monitoring.
- `docs/developer-cheat-sheet.md` – quick reference for daily tasks.

If you discover missing guidance, update the appropriate doc above rather than reviving this legacy file.
